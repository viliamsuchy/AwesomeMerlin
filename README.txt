Hello! This is AwesomeMerlin game. I Hope you will enjoy it and Good Luck!
There are some tips&tricks: 	PressurePlate will refuel your mana
				You have to kill enemies in good sequence
				When enemies touch you 2 time you will die(-50HP on one hit, yeaah i know, they are too strong XD)
				You can kill them with Fireball/Frostball - Frostball will deal more dmg but also cost more mana
